# DogAPIAssignmentThree
Create an app that loads a single random image for a specific breed, based on a user input. 

# Requirements:
- This app should account for the happy case when the breed is found, as well as the unhappy case when it is not. 
- Use the endpoint described in the "RANDOM IMAGE FROM A BREED COLLECTION" section of this page of the DogAPI docs. 
- Note that the API will return an HTTP status code of 404 along with a JSON object with info about the error if a request is made for a breed that can't be found.
